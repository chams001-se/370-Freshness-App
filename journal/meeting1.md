## Operating System ##
"Are we thinking of making it Android only or including iOS?"
We will prioritize making an Android app as there are less restrictions towards publishing an app on Android (downloading an .apk file) as opposed to going through the Apple App Store.
In the future, we will look towards Flutter to create a Java app for iOS.

## Deciding Roles ##
We will create a list of roles.
Afterwards, each team member will decide on which role they are interested in. Team members can take multiple roles.
- UX Designer
